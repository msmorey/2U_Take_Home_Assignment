# 2U Take Home Assignment: Curriculum & Content Strategy Lead

## Contents

I chose to design a Junior Data Scientist course. The course design can be found in the [Morey 2U Interview Assignment_ Junior Data Scientist.pdf](<Morey 2U Interview Assignment_ Junior Data Scientist.pdf>).

The sample lesson I designed for statistical t-tests using `SciPy`, and it can be found in the [Sample Lesson Plan - t-test](<Sample Lesson Plan - t-test>) folder. The solution for the activity in the lesson can be found in the [Sample Lesson Plan - t-test](<Sample Lesson Plan - t-test>) folder along with the associated CSV file.
